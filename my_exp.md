# My Experience at GDG WOW Pune

We learnt about MCP and RAG today. It was an amazing session where we got hands-on experience with:

1. Model Composition Pattern (MCP)
   - Understanding how to compose multiple AI models
   - Leveraging the strengths of different models for complex tasks
   - Building efficient pipelines for AI workflows

2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - Learning how to enhance LLM outputs with relevant information
   - Implementing knowledge retrieval systems
   - Improving response accuracy and relevance

The workshop provided great insights into advanced AI techniques and their practical applications. Looking forward to implementing these concepts in my future projects!

## Key Takeaways

- Practical applications of MCP in real-world scenarios
- How RAG improves context-aware responses
- Best practices for implementing these patterns
- Community connections with fellow developers and enthusiasts

Thank you to the organizers and presenters for this valuable learning opportunity!
